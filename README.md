# youtube-page

> In this project, we built a clone of the youtube page. We had to embed a video and a sidebar with video recommendations with embedded images.

The project is a responsive webpage, the video recommendation sidebar will jump to the bottom of the video description section after the threshold of 1400px width is reached, otherwise it should be displayed at the right of the webpage.
